# AI Cares Benchmak

This is a research project with the aim of quantifying the semantic difference between an answer generated by a LLM and a human
in the context of mental health chatbots.
A dataset was obtained with chat messages between a human operator and a user.
The goal is to, given an interaction between a human and a operator, if cut the chat right before the operator answer,
and ask the LLM to produce a response, how similar is that answer to the human answer?
